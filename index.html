                Hi! I'm Vidith, I'm currently a sophomore CS major here at TAMU.
               <br><br>
                Here are some of my involvements:
                <ul>
                    <li>Competitor in <a href="https://icpc.global/" target="_blank">TAMU ICPC teams</a></li>
                    <li>Officer of <a href="https://tamuacpc.com/" target="_blank">TAMU ACPC</a></li>
                    <li>Incoming software intern @ Amazon</li>
                    <li>Multi-time <a href="https://devpost.com/vm951" target="_blank">hackathon winner</a></li>
                    <li>Undergraduate <a href="https://irl.cs.tamu.edu" target="_blank">researcher</a></li>
                    <li>Discrete math enthusiast</li>

                I have worked on numerous projects that I believe in. I try not to create projects just for the sake of creating something -
                rather, I seek inspiration from my day-to-day needs and problems in the community. Lately, I've also been trying 
                to incorporate my interests/skills (mainly algorithms) into what I make. Here are some examples of what I've built in the past:
                <ul>
                    <li>COVID-19 geolocation contact tracing <a href="https://safefromcovid.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">webapp</a></li>
                    <li>Music analyzer Chromium extension</li>
                    <li>Full-stack messaging webapp</li>
                    <li>FTC robotics event <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brokenaxles.ftcteamscouter" target="_blank">scouting app</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>

                My skills include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Languages: C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Rust</li>
                    <li>Technologies: NodeJS, Django, Flask</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                I am interested in further exploring machine learning, blockchain, and Web3. Machine learning is the only one 
                of these domains where I have some prior experience (albeit limited). I am drawn towards it mainly due to the 
                need to massively transform and process data with fast algorithms. I am also fascinated with the applications
                of linear algebra and how it can be used to generalize wide varieties of datasets.
                While I haven't really worked with blockchain, the P2P structure of the entire network and the clever tricks needed
                to make it work (like proof-of-work schemes) amaze me.

                During the summer before our senior year of high school, my friends and I decided to create a <a href="https://youngbytes.wixsite.com/main" target="_blank">tutoring
                organization</a> directed at sparking an interest in science and technology in young children. While no longer managed by us, we made a huge
                impact during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing students access to low-cost tutoring. We also raised ~$100 for the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate" target="_blank">WHO COVID-19 fund</a>. 
                <br><br>
                In the future, I hope to serve the competitive programming community through activities such as problemsetting and event organization. Many large tech companies
                host their own annual programming competitions (like <a href="https://facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup" target="_blank">Facebook Hacker Cup</a> and <a href="https://g.co/codejam" target="_blank">Google Code Jam</a>). If I one day end up
                working at these companies, it would be a great honor to work behind-the-scenes to make these competitions possible!
